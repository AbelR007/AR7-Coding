# Python Small Programs


As I progress through Computer programming or more specifically python programming, I post codes I learned or understood here.
Most of the codes won't be officially produced by me. But during the learning process, I love twisting conceptual coding and add my own unique things here and there. Codes provided may not be of top notch quality but it's pretty standard to me.

1. Color Mixer [RGB Version]
An API made by me to form your favourite colour by using the *COLOR Mixer [RGB version]*. This code helps you to create an infinite no. of different, unique colours and you can have pretty fun with it. It was a pretty good project and certainly plan to make it more advance. 

2. Managemenet Program [Still Working on]
