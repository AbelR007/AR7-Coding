# Basic Python Codes

Basic Codes in Python which are made mostly by me. Feel free to use them or know about them.

Some of the Codes are :

1. **Simple Calculator 2.0**
2. Python Definitons [Python Examples for Beginners]
3. Color Mixer (RGB Turtle)

### Note :
Bolded ones are made completely by me
Others are helped or sourced by someone else
